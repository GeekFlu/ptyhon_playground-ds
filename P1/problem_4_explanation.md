# Active Directory

## Design
- Using helper methods os.listdir and os.path.join we get for the current directory all the files and group them into files with the suffix and directories
## Time complexity
- The time complexity O(n), being n the directories and files we need to scan from parent to children directories
## Space complexity
- The space required for active directory is linear O(n)
